## An UnOffical Hack Club YSWS 

---

## Launch Date: Sometime in January 

## Duration: 1 month Minimum

## Website:To Be Made

### You Ship:
Participants will design and develop a fully playable Game Boy-compatible game. Using tools like GB Studio (Link) or custom coding solutions, they’ll create a unique, original game that fits the retro style of the Game Boy. Once complete, they’ll submit their game file for flashing.

### We Ship:
We’ll take the submitted game files, flash them onto real Game Boy cartridges, and ship the completed cartridges back to participants. Each cartridge will be a fully functional, playable version of their game that can be used on actual Game Boy hardware. We’ll also provide resources like tutorials and community support to help participants through the development process.

### What Participants Will Gain: 
Participants will learn how to create games for one of the most iconic handheld consoles in history, gaining hands-on experience in building and deploying a real, playable cartridge. The challenge of working with a limited cartridge size will teach them the skills older developers used to optimize their games, pushing them to think creatively within constraints.
